# MSSA
Within this repository are many of the projects I've worked on over the course of the Microsoft Software Systems Academy (MSSA). I keep them here to practice documentation, utilizing git between the three different systems I use and to go back into to study when I need to brush up on something. 

Some of the work I've done is not necessarily for MSSA, but doesn't necessitate it's own repo.

### C# Midterm
The assignment was to use five different methods from each of three different **C# Namespaces**. Right now this is just a block of commented out code. I need to clean it up with *Console.ReadLine();* in a few places and make this work more like a program. Instead of a bunch of text.
