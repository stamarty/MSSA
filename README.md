# MSSA
Within this repository are many of the projects I've worked on over the course of the Microsoft Software Systems Academy (MSSA). I keep them here to practice documentation, utilizing git between the three different systems I use and to go back into to study when I need to brush up on something. 

Some of the work I've done is not necessarily for MSSA, but doesn't necessitate it's own repo.

C# Class (CSC 205)
---------------
### C# Midterm
The assignment was to use five different methods from each of three different **C# Namespaces**. Right now this is just a block of commented out code. I need to clean it up with *Console.ReadLine();* in a few places and make this work more like a program. Instead of a bunch of text.

[X] using System;
+ Console.Beep();
+ Math.Pow();
+ Math.SQRT();
+ Math.Round();
+ ArrayTypeMismatch Exception

[X] using System.IO;
+ File.Create();
+ Console.WriteLine();
+ File.Copy();
+ File.ReadAllText();
+ File.Delete();

[X] using System.Media;
+ PlaySync();
+ SystemSounds.Asterisk.Play();
+ player.PlayLooping();
+ player.Stop();
+ player.Load(); and player.Play();


### C# Module 2
Lessons learned regarding **overloading methods** from Module 2 of the textbook. This is commented more than I normally would comment due to the wishes of my instructor.  

### C# Module 3
Lessons learned regarding **Hashtables** from Module 3 of the textbook. This is commented more than I normally would comment due to the wishes of my instructor.

### C# BMI Calculator
Migrated *BMI-Calculator* from it's own repo. This was an assignment for CSC 205, but is not a significant enough program to warrant it's own repo. I wrote this program within the first couple weeks of learning C#. There is almost no evidence of **DRY** principles (i.e. no methods involved at all yet). I plan on updating this eventually to make it an actual program. 

[] Open issue for refactoring of BMI Calculator.
