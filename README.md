# MSSA
Within this repository are many of the projects I've worked on over the course of the Microsoft Software Systems Academy (MSSA). I keep them here to practice documentation, utilizing git between the three different systems I use and to go back into to study when I need to brush up on something. 

Some of the work I've done is not necessarily for MSSA, but doesn't necessitate it's own repo.
