# MSSA

Within this repository are many of the projects I've worked on over the course of the Microsoft Software Systems Academy (MSSA). I keep them here to practice documentation, utilizing git between the three different systems I use and to go back into to study when I need to brush up on something.

Some of the work I've done is not necessarily for MSSA, but doesn't necessitate it's own repo.

## C# Class (CSC 205)

---------------

### C# Midterm

The assignment was to use five different methods from each of three different **C# Namespaces**. Right now this is just a block of commented out code. I need to clean it up with *Console.ReadLine();* in a few places and make this work more like a program. Instead of a bunch of text.

#### using System

- Console.Beep();
- Math.Pow();
- Math.SQRT();
- Math.Round();
- ArrayTypeMismatch Exception

#### using System.IO

- File.Create();
- Console.WriteLine();
- File.Copy();
- File.ReadAllText();
- File.Delete();

#### using System.Media

- PlaySync();
- SystemSounds.Asterisk.Play();
- player.PlayLooping();
- player.Stop();
- player.Load(); and player.Play();

### C# Module 2

Lessons learned regarding **overloading methods** from Module 2 of the textbook. This is commented more than I normally would comment due to the wishes of my instructor.  

### C# Module 3

Lessons learned regarding **Hashtables** from Module 3 of the textbook. This is commented more than I normally would comment due to the wishes of my instructor.

### C# BMI Calculator

Migrated *BMI-Calculator* from it's own repo. This was an assignment for CSC 205, but is not a significant enough program to warrant it's own repo. I wrote this program within the first couple weeks of learning C#. There is almost no evidence of **DRY** principles (i.e. no methods involved at all yet). I plan on updating this eventually to make it an actual program.

[] Open issue for refactoring of BMI Calculator.

## Intro to C# on [EdEx](https://miledu.microsoft.com/login?next=/mssainfo)

---------------

### Intro to C# Module 1

Build "teacher" and "students" without using classes, or methods. This is a lot of gibberish. There is a much easier way to do this.

### Intro to C# Module 2

Lots of work here with **if, else statements**, **for loops** and **while loops**.

### Intro to C# Module 3

Began working with methods. We are now creating teachers and students a little more eficiently.

### Intro to C# Module 4

Not complete yet.

## Personal Practice Files

---------------

This probably needs to be reorganized even further. Included in here are the following "programs".

### Count up

How many times do you want to say a particular phrase? This is the console app for you!

### Fibonacci Generator

My first program that actually does something. This was a challenge working through the **algorithm** and practicing "**thinking like a programmer**". This version is completed in **C#**

### Python Fibonacci Generator

Learning **Python** and **C#** at the same time poses some challenges. This is the Python version of *Fibonacci Generator*.
