This is just a test .txt file to practice with documentation and commiting to Git. 
Presumably, I'll be able to save this in the current solution I am working on. 

How do we make changes online (or remotely) and have them synched to all the computers
I want them to be synched to?

First we fetch from GitHub, then we pull. Fetch only tells that there are changes? 
Pull actually synchs them.
